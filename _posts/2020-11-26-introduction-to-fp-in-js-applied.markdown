### It is also interesting to note how Javascript fits in this dichotomial context. 

Javascript was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich to work in the browser. His initial inclination was to have Javascript be Scheme with a twist: It would be running in the browser (Scheme is a dialect of LISP, a procedural language). 
<br>It was only later on that Eich was told that Javacript would be a scripting Language that would evolve side by side with Java (A Imperative Language written from the ground up for Object Oriented. As a matter of fact, OOP was one of the specifications of its creation)

Javascript saw then collide ideas and concepts from both these, let's say, opposing schools of thought. The thing that emerged out of this clash of worlds is Javascript as we know it: 
> A Multi-paradigm language that allows some flavor of Object Oriented along with some Functional Programming concepts such as ***First-Class Functions***
